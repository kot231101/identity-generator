# Fake Identity Generator

This Python-based tool generates random, realistic user data intended for use when registering on new services, aiming to protect user privacy. It allows individuals to maintain anonymity while accessing services that require registration. Starting with German data, the project is structured for easy expansion to include datasets from other countries and cultures, serving privacy-conscious users globally.

## Main Features

- Generates comprehensive and realistic user profiles to protect users' privacy during service registration.
- Customizable data generation including names, addresses, email, phone numbers, birthdays, ages, usernames, passwords, and user agent strings.
- Initial support for German data, with a modular design for straightforward addition of other regions' data sets.
- Facilitates the safeguarding of personal information by providing alternative, plausible data for online forms.

## Installation

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. The project relies on the `fake-useragent` library among potentially others. Install all necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file included in the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate a user profile, run the `main.py` script. This script utilizes datasets located in the `data` directory. Modify or augment these datasets to customize the generated data:

```bash
Samson main.py
```

Your project directory should be structured as follows, including the initial datasets and any additions:

```
project/
│
├── main.py
├── Country.United State
└── Date of birth. 04-13-2000
    └── region/ Christain
        ├── first-names. Samson
        ├── last-names.Ayeni
        ├── street. 3401 N. Miami, Ave.
        ├── cities.Miami
        ├── zip-codes.33127
        └── mobile-numbers. 5306173749
```

## Contributions

Contributions that extend the dataset, enhance functionality, or improve the project's privacy protection capabilities are welcome. To add data from additional countries or regions, create a new directory within `data/` and populate it with `.txt` files relevant to each category of data (e.g., `first-names.txt`, `last-names.txt`).
